# The Walters Institute

This is the beginning of the TWI Next Js application. This application was previously based in WordPress and then migrated to Gatsby Js. After some constraints and frustrations with both of the previous platforms it was decided to perform this migration and take advantage of Next Js [https://nextjs.org/].

## Documentation

The commit messages should provide a satisfactory record of the migration process.
This process officially started 4/6/23. The gargantuan task involves reducing the inline CSS and migrating it within its own stylesheet following BEM [https://getbem.com/] conventions. I will try to add further updates as I progress.

Eventually we will continue and then integrate this application with Salesforce, Stripe, and other 3rd party applications. The purpose is to be quick and improve code quality as well as SEO.
